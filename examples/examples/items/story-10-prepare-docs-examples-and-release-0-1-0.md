### Story ID
STORY-10

### Status
Backlog

### Description
As a maintainer, I want a documented release process and examples so users can start within 15 minutes and we can publish safely.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README: install, .env, CLI examples, common errors
- [ ] examples/trello include sections and block formats; examples/items shows exports
- [ ] Build to dist, CHANGELOG, npm publish --access public; rollback via npm deprecate + patch
