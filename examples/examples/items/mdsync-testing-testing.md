## Story: Testing

### Story ID
mdsync-testing

### Status
Testing

### Description
Cards come here after being code reviewed, and we're in a place for QA and fixing things QA finds. Design review also happens at this stage.

If we have too many cards here, we should throw a flag and figure out whether we're building things that take too many passes of QA, or if we're bottlenecked on QA time.

### Acceptance Criteria
