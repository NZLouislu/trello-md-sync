## Story: Backlog

### Story ID
mdsync-backlog

### Status
Backlog

### Description
A list of the things we think we want to do, maybe not quite ready for work, but high likelihood of being worked on.

This is the staging area where specs should get fleshed out.

No limit on the list size, but we should reconsider if it gets long.

### Acceptance Criteria
